# Analyzing Ecommerce Sales Trends with Power Bi

As part of my data analytics work, I recently created a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to visualize Tariq's ecommerce sales data. This dashboard provides deep insights into key business metrics and trends.

# Some of the key insights from the dashboard include:

* Profit by month, showing seasonal fluctuations and growth over time
* Top selling sub-categories, with printers, bookcases, and furniture being the best performers
* Sales by category, with clothing, electronics, and furniture making up the largest portions
* Payment method breakdown, with UPI, COD, and credit/debit cards being the top modes
* Top customers by total order value
* Profit by state, highlighting regional sales performance
  
The dashboard enables Tariq's team to quickly identify growth opportunities, optimize product mixes, and make data-driven decisions. Visualizing the data in this interactive format makes it much easier to spot trends and patterns compared to static reports.
